## Portfolio

Who: Potential employers
What: A website that highlights projects and shows my resume in a more interactive way.
When: It’s static and will be used as hiring employers and recruiters visit the site.
Why: The resume looks good, but seeing the different aspects of it in action would make it much stronger. 

## Feature List

- Presentation task: I’m playing with the idea of having a carousel that cycles through a single image with a link to the various projects, a future blog, and an about page.

- Menu Bar: the site will also have a classic menu bar centered at the top of the page. I’m not excited about having something so blah, but for some people it would help them navigate.

- About page: After my front page is complete I want to build my “About” page. I’m doing this because I can bring in some nicely designed players to have a few videos from my resume.

## Considerations

- must work with mobile. Probably make good use of flexboxes 
- Text over images in Carousel, has pause button. Clicking on any frame opens a new html page 
- Embedded videos must have pause button, will have slider of progression player
  
 ## Time
  - Carousel will take a day.
  - Video player may take a half day.
  - Html & CSS will take a day in a half.
